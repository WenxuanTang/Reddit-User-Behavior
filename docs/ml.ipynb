        "# Questions we want to answer\n",
        "As the biggest channel on Reddit, the “AskReddit” subreddit contains a huge amount of questions and answers. When people try to dive into this ocean of Q&As, some may want their answers to be more valuable as they could get gilded from the thankful viewers, while others might just want to maintain their manners and become a part of the grand audience. Thus, in order to explore the potential strategies for an AskReddit user to make hot/proper comments, we performed machine learning techniques to drill into two of the business goals proposed earlier: \n",
        "\n",
        "* What posts are more likely to be gilded and whether controversiality is an important factor to be gilded?\n",
        "* What kind of accounts are more likely to be cancelled?\n",
        "\n",
        "With the help of machine learning models and feature importance plots, we conclude that posts with a higher “score”(a feature calculated by subtracting the number of dislikes from the number of likes) are more likely to be gilded and “controversiality” is also an important factor to be considered. Moreover, there are indeed multiple factors influencing the gilded option and we have summarized the top 10 most influential features. At the same time, we also compared the posts of users who have been cancelled with those of normal users. From our model result, we found that cancelled accounts are more likely to post content that has been banned by Reddit moderators. Therefore, Reddit users should be aware of the moderation rules before posting in order to ensure a smooth forum experience and avoid being banned for posting inappropriate content.\n",
        "\n",
        "# I. What posts are more likely to be gilded?\n",
        "## Summary\n",
        "We want to analyze and predict whether a post is gilded. It is obviously a binary classification. To address the first business goal, we build different machine learning models based on comment features and specific text. And finally we found that posts with higher score tend to be more likely to receive gild. The score is an indicator calculated by subtracting the number of dislikes from the number of likes.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Preparation\n",
        "In this part, we prepared the dataset including features and label for machine learning model. After checking the distribution of label, We found there is a label imbalance problem. We applied under-sampling method that deleted some data from rows of data from the majority classes to maintain the label balance in training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Feature Engineering \n",
        "In the feature engineering part, we created 9 new feature including time range of post, sentiment class and body length using NLP pipeline and sentiment analysis. To be more specifically, we applied NLP pipeline to clean 'body' feature, build sentiment analysis model to create sentiment class of 'body' and used timestamp function to extract the hour and day of week of the comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Machine Learning Model\n",
        "For the machine learning process, we first applied the 2 models listed below:\n",

        "\n",
        "These two models are built on the selected comment features including controversiality, whether edited more than once, score, hour, day of week, length of clean body, sentiment class etc. The comments post is split into training and testing datasets. And 5-fold cross-validation is applied to tune the hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Then we applied another 2 models on content of the comment listed below:\n",

Among these top 10 features, “score” has the most impact on the gilded option, while although other features like “Monday” are not as outstanding as “score”, they also have an influence on the gilded option. Overall, posts with controversiality does have an impact on the gilded action, but it is not the main influencing factor.

        "After summarizing the gilding pattern of comments, we turned to focus on the pattern of comments whose author’s account got cancelled.<br>\n",
        "To address the second business goal, we decide to first filter the data and then apply different machine learning models based on the generated features. And each model has its own advantage and shortcoming in evaluating the post. Thus, the audience should flexibly choose the model based on their preference. The results suggest that the majority reason for account cancelation is caused by regulation of moderators. \n",

        "## Data Preparation\n",
        "In this section, we also took the label imbalance problem into consideration and applied the same method to deal with it.<br>\n",
        "In order to solve the business goal (what kind of account is more likely to be cancelled), our group first decided to obtain the target dataset from posts in the “askreddit” subreddit; while posts made by cancelled users have “[deleted]” as their author, we also filtered out the posts with “[deleted]” for both author and body, since they only indicate that their authors decided to delete the post; after collecting posts from actual cancelled users, we randomly collected similar number of posts whose authors are still active, so our machine learning models could make comparisons to fetch the embedded patterns for actual cancelled users.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Feature Engineering \n",
        "For the stage of feature engineering, while we tagged the removed-by-moderator posts with “[removed]” body as a feature, we wanted to put the messy column of body into usage, so we applied text preprocessing techniques on existing body texts through NLP pipelines(TF-IDF, sentiment model). The TF-IDF pipeline is applied to help identify the commonly-used words in posts with cancelled user, and we manually extract 10 keywords from the top 30 common words, generating a new feature describing existence of these keywords in the body text. Then, the sentiment model is deployed to analyze the sentiment of the posts, which is also included in the dataset as a predictor of the account deletion status.\n",

        "* As the main ways to measure the value of a post, score and gilded seem to have little importance in predicting account cancellation.
